## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How do I install Viper?

As briefly covered in the README, you've multiple choices for installing Viper.

#### Windows

There's the installer, and the portable `.exe`, we recommend using the installer as it can auto update, there's a Download button on the README which downloads the newest version of the installer.

#### Linux

On the [releases page](https://github.com/0neGal/viper/releases/latest) there are various package distributions we release, feel free to pick any one of them, but as with Windows only one of them supports auto-installation, that one being the AppImage.

#### After Install

After you've gotten Viper installed you'll select your game path (this may or may not be done automatically, however if we can't find your game automatically we'll ask you to select it manually), then go onto the Northstar tab, click "Install", and now you can launch Northstar and have fun on the frontier.

If you keep getting errors about your game path being wrong follow the [instructions further below...](#this-folder-is-not-a-valid-game-path)

### How do I install mods?

We recommend using Thunderstore, which allows you to easily find mods and install them, to do so simply go into the Northstar tab, then go into the Mods section, and there'll be a button aptly named **"Find Mods"**, clicking it will open an easy to use UI that'll let you search for mods and install them.

### "This folder is not a valid game path."

When selecting a game path make sure it actually is *the game path*. Your game path is where the `Titanfall2.exe` is located, usually inside `C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Titanfall2`, however if you've installed the game somewhere else or you've installed the game through Steam it may be located somewhere else.

For Steam users, you can inside Steam right click on the game, click **Properties**, then in the window that opens **Local Files**, then **Browse**, the folder that it opens is the game path.

Ideally Viper should be able to find Titanfall automatically, however given we can't predict every installation of the game we can't always find the game.

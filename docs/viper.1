\fBviper\fR \- update and manage northstar
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
\fBviper\fP [<optional>\|\.\.\.]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Viper is a program made to make updating and launching Northstar a lot easier\. It has both a CLI and GUI tool, specifying no command line arguments opens the latter\. Viper also is able to update itself, that is if you've the AppImage or NSIS version\.
.SH OPTIONS
.P
\fB\-\-help\fP
   Shows a brief message of all the options and what they do\.
.P
\fB\-\-version\fP
   Various versions numbers for Node, Electron, Viper and so on\.
.P
\fB\-\-cli\fP
   Forces the CLI to activate, meaning the GUI will never run\. 
   What purpose this has I frankly do not know\.
.P
\fB\-\-update\fP
   Updates Northstar, this uses your \fBviper\.json\fP to determine the location, it also won't try to update if the installed version of Northstar is already the newest, if you must re\-install Northstar you can delete the \fBns_version\.txt\fP file in the game path\.
.P
\fB\-\-updatevp\fP
   Updates Viper itself, by default CLI does not have auto updates, as a server owner may not want this, so use this option to update\.
.P
\fB\-\-launch\fP=<version>
   Launches Northstar, this is currently only supported on Windows\.
   If you must launch Vanilla you can run \fB\-\-launch=vanilla\fP
.P
\fB\-\-setpath\fP=<absolute\-path>
   Sets the game path, this'll change the \fBgamepath\fP variable in your \fBviper\.json\fP, note that it only takes in absolute paths and not relative ones\.
.P
\fB\-\-mods\fP
   Lists out all installed mods, and gives a count on how many are installed, enabled and or disabled\.
.P
\fB\-\-installmod\fP=<absolute\-path>
   Installs a mod, this supports both Zip files and folders, just that the \fBmod\.json\fP file is easily found is all that matters\.
.P
\fB\-\-removemod\fP=<mod name>
   Removes a mod, the mod name should be taken from \fB\-\-mods\fP as it provides accurate names\. Putting in \fBallmods\fP will remove all mods, no confirmation\.
.P
\fB\-\-togglemod\fP=<mod name>
   Toggles a mod, the mod name should be taken from \fB\-\-mods\fP as it provides accurate names\. Putting in \fBallmods\fP will toggle all mods\. Keep in mind, if a mod is already disabled and some mods are enabled, the states will be flipped, so 3 enabled and 1 disabled, goes to 1 enabled and 3 disabled\.
.SH CONFIGURATION
.P
All configuration takes place in your \fBviper\.json\fP file, this file may be in various locations depending on your platform, for Linux you're likely to find it at:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/viper\.json\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB~/\.config/viper\.json\fP

.RE
.P
On Windows it's likely to be in \fB%APPDATA%\\viper\.json\fP
.P
All configuration is done by Viper itself, the locale is auto set when the GUI launches through your systems locale, the gamepath is selected with \fB\-\-setpath\fP or in the GUI\.
.SH MOD SUPPORT
.P
To toggle mods since Northstar itself has no filter as to what mods it loads, we have to move the mods into a separate folder, that folder being \fBdisabled\fP inside \fBR2Northstar/mods\fP, so you can also just manually move these if you want\.
.SH BUGS
.P
Report bugs on the GitHub issues page, and feel free to make a pull request if you also have the fix to the bug\.
